* more efficiently calculate percentiles
    * get extreme percentiles e.g. 10th and 90th.
    * then the next percentiles are known to be in between. will make eqn solver faster.
    * may have to wrap scipy's ppf() to get access to brentq
* refactor
	* https://pypi.org/project/pep8/
* new ways to inputs distributions
	* kernel density estimation
	* fit distribution to quartiles/deciles
	* additional distribution types
* advanced settings
    * move graph domain override into advanced
    allow setting custom percentiles
* form validation
* pass parameters in URL
